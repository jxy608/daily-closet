# Daily Closet
Daily Closet is your one-stop-shop for closet management and daily outfit recommendations, so you can know what to wear without having to use your brain. Whether it’s sun, rain, or snow, you’ll have a perfect outfit ready to go!


New users to Daily Closet can upload photos of their clothes and assign them an appropriate temperature range for the article of clothing. From there, you’ll get an outfit recommended to you daily based on the temperature and weather in your location. Don’t like the outfit generated? You can shuffle to get a new one recommended to you, or swap out individual items to build your perfect outfit. Daily Closet also keeps track of the number of times you’ve accepted or declined to wear certain articles of clothing, and can recommend you sell or donate clothes you don’t wear often to free up closet space!


You can view and manage your closet including all of the clothes you’ve uploaded to the website on our closet page, which is categorized into sections to be easily accessible. You’ll also be able to add new articles of clothing in this page after a retail therapy session.


Each of the clothing categories will bring up a simple pop-up menu where you can scroll through your catalog of clothes, as well as sort and filter your clothes to find that one shirt you’re looking for. You can also edit your individual clothes through this menu if you realize that the sweater your mom gave you wasn’t quite as warm as you thought it would be.
